# Food delivery code test

## Resources

### Design 
You can find the design in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/yw7DttG4w7F28tmTaxXrLh/Code-test?node-id=64:106).
Interactions can be seen by pressing presentation except the filter, which should alter the restaurant list so it only shows restaurants with that tag, but if you want to save time it's ok to just show the filter buttons and not add this functionality.

### Endpoints
You can find the endpoints and example responses in [Postman](https://www.postman.com), 
[Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and add the collection url by pressing File -> Import or by pressing **âŒ˜**+O and add the link
